# Cell Tracking ProjectThis repository contains a Python-based implementation for tracking and modeling cell alignments across fluorescence microscopy sections. The project utilizes a **probabilistic graph alignment framework** to robustly handle cell tracking, leveraging topological relationships, spatial features, and Bayesian inference for accuracy.## Features- Probabilistic modeling with **Bayesian inference** for tracking cells across noisy and distorted tissue sections.- **Graph-based representation** of cells to incorporate spatial relationships.- Handles **cell births and deaths** across sections.- Implements a **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** sampling approach to optimize cell alignments.---## Table of Contents- [Installation](#installation)- [Usage](#usage)- [Data Format](#data-format)- [Pipeline](#pipeline)- [Project Structure](#project-structure)- [Results](#results)- [Future Work](#future-work)- [License](#license)---## Installation1. **Clone the Repository**:   ```bash   git clone https://github.com/username/cell-tracking-project.git   cd cell-tracking-project   ```2. **Install Dependencies**:   Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required packages:   ```bash   pip install -r requirements.txt   ```3. **Verify Setup**:   Run the script to ensure the environment is correctly set up:   ```bash   python main.py   ```---## Usage1. **Prepare Your Data**:   Place your fluorescence microscopy measurements in the `data/` folder. Ensure the file matches the expected format (see [Data Format](#data-format)).2. **Run the Tracker**:   Execute the main script:   ```bash   python main.py   ```3. **Results**:   After running, tracking results will be saved as `tracking_results.csv`, containing the cell correspondences between sections.---## Data FormatThe input data must be in CSV format with the following columns:- **Image**: Section name (e.g., "Section_1", "Section_2").- **Name**: Unique identifier for each cell within a section.- **Centroid X µm** and **Centroid Y µm**: Cell centroid coordinates in micrometers.- **Area**: Area of the cell in square micrometers.- **Perimeter**: Perimeter of the cell in micrometers.- **Distance in um to nearest Cell**: Distance to the nearest neighbor cell.Sample data:```csvImage,Name,Centroid X µm,Centroid Y µm,Area,Perimeter,Distance in um to nearest CellSection_1,Cell_1,15.3,20.4,50.2,18.7,5.6Section_1,Cell_2,25.1,30.6,47.8,17.2,4.8Section_2,Cell_1,15.8,21.0,51.0,19.0,5.9...```---## Pipeline1. **Data Loading**:   - The script reads microscopy data and constructs graphs for each section, where nodes represent cells, and edges capture spatial relationships.2. **Graph Alignment**:   - A probabilistic matching matrix aligns cells across sections, using features such as centroid positions, area, and perimeter.3. **MCMC Sampling**:   - The alignment parameters and matching matrices are optimized iteratively using MCMC to maximize posterior probability.4. **Results**:   - The final tracking results are saved in a CSV file, identifying correspondences between cells in consecutive sections.---## Project Structure```cell-tracking-project/├── main.py              # Entry point for the program├── src/│   ├── cell_graph.py     # CellGraph class (handles graph construction)│   ├── transformation.py # Transformation class (handles spatial transformations)│   └── mcmc_tracker.py   # MCMCTracker class (implements tracking logic)├── data/│   └── multisectionmeasurements.csv # Input dataset├── output/│   └── tracking_results.csv # Tracking results├── tests/               # Unit tests│   └── test_mcmc.py├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies└── README.md            # Documentation```---## Results### MetricsThe performance of the tracker is evaluated based on:- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly tracked cells.- **Recall**: Fraction of actual cell trajectories captured.- **Precision**: Degree of uniqueness in identified trajectories.- **Track Fragmentation**: Average number of breaks in a cell's trajectory.- **Mean Track Length**: Average number of sections a cell is tracked across.### Sample OutputExample tracking results are saved in `output/tracking_results.csv`:```csvSource_Section,Source_Cell,Target_Section,Target_CellSection_1,Cell_1,Section_2,Cell_3Section_1,Cell_2,Section_2,Cell_1Section_2,Cell_3,Section_3,Cell_2...```---## Future Work- **Scalability**: Extend the approach to handle larger datasets and 3D tissue architectures.- **Feature Integration**: Incorporate additional features like cell intensity and shape descriptors.- **Semi-Supervised Corrections**: Allow user input for ambiguous regions to improve accuracy.---## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
